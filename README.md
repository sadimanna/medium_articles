# 1. Getting updates on ongoing Deep Learning model training, remotely on your device, using Telegram bot

This article is not actually a tutorial on “How to send messages using Telegram bot to your device” 
but that part has been covered too (you can find lots of better tutorial on the web on that topic). 
This article aims at showing a simple implementation of how the above mentioned feature can be utilised 
to send regular updates to your device, when you are not directly observing your Deep Learning model training, 
running on a remote machine, or not present in your Lab to keep an eye on the training progress and statistics.
